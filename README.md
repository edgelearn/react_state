# ReactJS State

Run the following command to get a basic ReactJS application setup:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
yarn start
```

## Setting Initial State

1. Create a function component inside my-app/src/Component.js as you had done in previous exercises.

2. Convert the function component to class component

3. Set initial state in constructor

4. Modify my-app/src/index.js to use Component.js instead of App.js in the import line.

## setState API

1. Create onChange arrow function inside the class that takes a value and calls setState

## Using state in render

1. Access the state object to get a value

2. Pass the value to an input field

3. Set the onChange of the input field to be the function we made earlier

After you have completed all of the exercises, commit your changes with the following command:

```
git commit -am "ReactJS State Examples"
```
